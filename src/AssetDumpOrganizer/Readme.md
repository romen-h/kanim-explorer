# Asset Dump Organizer

This program helps with organizing the extracted game assets into nicely organized folders.  
It is still in development and only handles kanim files for now.

```
Assets/
  Kanims/
    some_kanim_name/
      some_kanim_name_0.png
      some_kanim_name_anim.bytes
      some_kanim_name_build.bytes
    some_other_kanim/
      ...
```

## How to use this

1. Extract the game assets using [AssetStudio](https://github.com/zhangjiequan/AssetStudio)
2. Run AssetDumpOrganizer.exe
3. Select the folder that you extracted the assets to.
4. Select a new folder to organize the assets into.
